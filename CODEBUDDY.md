# DDAD in Teams - Codebase Guide

This repository contains the DDAD (Document-Driven Agile Development) methodology guide for team Vibe Coding development practices.

## Repository Structure

This is a book/documentation project organized as follows:

- **Core Chapters**: `chapter1.md` to `chapter7.md` - Main content covering DDAD methodology
- **Supporting Documents**: 
  - `SUMMARY.md` - Table of contents for the book
  - `README.md` - Project overview and introduction
  - `DDAD-Vibe-Coding-PPT.md` - Presentation format of the methodology
  - `diaoyanwenjuan.md` - Survey questionnaire for team collaboration assessment
- **Configuration**: `.codebuddy/` - Codebuddy tool configuration directory

## Content Architecture

The book follows a structured progression through the DDAD methodology:

### Chapter 1: Introduction
- AI coding tool evolution and team development challenges

## Development & Documentation Workflow

### Content Management
- All content is written in Markdown format
- Each chapter follows a consistent structure with clear headings
- Use `SUMMARY.md` as the navigation guide for the entire book

### Style Guidelines
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the methodology
- Use clear, concise language suitable for technical team members
- Include practical examples and case studies where appropriate

### Update Process
1. Edit individual chapter files
2. Update `SUMMARY.md` if adding new sections
3. Review cross-references between chapters
4. Ensure terminology consistency across all documents

## Project Information

This project documents the DDAD methodology - a Document-Driven Agile Development approach that combines Vibe Coding practices with AI-assisted team collaboration. The content is designed for development teams looking to integrate AI tools into their workflows while maintaining high-quality collaboration standards.

The methodology emphasizes structured documentation, psychological safety in team environments, and intelligent tool orchestration to achieve superior development outcomes.
